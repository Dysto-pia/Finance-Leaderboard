# Project Checklist

## 🔧 1. Core Concept & Planning

- [x] Define purpose: “Help people improve financial habits using gamified progress and peer accountability.”
- [~] Identify target users (not explicitly coded, but implied for general users)
- [x] Clarify the key behavior you want to reward (saving, savings rate)
- [x] Choose the metric system: habit-based, relative improvement, not raw wealth (savings rate used)
- [ ] Decide your ethical monetization model(s)

---

## 🧠 2. Financial Behavior & Scoring System

- [x] Define “financial responsibility” with clear actions (e.g., paid bills, saved X%, reduced debt)
- [x] Assign point values or progress levels to those actions (score based on savings rate)
- [x] Create leveling system or tiered ranks (e.g., Bronze → Platinum Saver)
- [x] Allow user customization of goals (profile goal input)

---

## 📊 3. Leaderboard Mechanics

- [x] Choose leaderboard type (progress-based, not friends-only)
- [~] Add privacy options (opt-out, pseudonyms, private mode)
- [x] Show meaningful metrics (e.g., “% of goal completed,” not just “$ net worth”)
- [x] Offer non-comparative stats too (dashboard shows self-progress)

---

## 📚 4. Education System

- [x] Create bite-sized, personalized lessons (text lessons, personalized by profile/goals)
- [x] Recommend lessons based on user behavior (overspending, goals)
- [~] Add challenges (e.g., “No-spend weekend,” “Save $100 in 10 days”)
- [ ] Track progress through learning modules

---

## 🔐 5. User Onboarding & Data Handling

- [x] Account creation with basic profile and financial goals
- [x] Secure integration with financial APIs (Plaid, encrypted tokens)
- [x] Transparent permissions (explained in UI, Plaid info)
- [x] Zero 3rd-party data selling, ever (no evidence of data selling)

---

## 🎮 6. Gamification Features

- [ ] Daily/weekly streaks for good habits
- [x] Badges for milestones (dummy badges implemented)

---

## 💰 7. Monetization System

---

## 🧪 8. MVP Build

- [x] Core dashboard (score, recent progress, insights)

- [x] Financial data input (manual or via API)
- [x] Leaderboard prototype (private/anonymized)

- [x] Friendly, non-judgmental tone and copy
- [x] Simple, accessible UI (no dark mode yet)
- [x] Progress visualization tools (stats, some insights)
- [x] Emotional safety (no shaming UI)

---

## 🚀 10. Launch & Post-Launch

- [ ] Beta test with early users (collect brutally honest feedback)
- [~] Refine scoring/education based on behavior (lessons adapt to profile, but not full feedback loop)
- [ ] Add new content regularly (lessons, tools, challenges)
- [ ] Measure retention, engagement, goal completion
- [x] Keep improving privacy/security as usage scales (secure tokens, no data selling)
